=== Zbkc: Carry-less multiplication for Cryptography

[NOTE,caption=Frozen]
====
The Zbkc extension is frozen.
====

Carry-less multiplication is the multiplication in the polynomial ring over
GF(2). This is a critical operation in some cryptographic workloads,
particularly the AES-GCM authenticated encryption scheme.
This extension provides only the instructions needed to
efficiently implement the GHASH operation, which is part of this workload.
